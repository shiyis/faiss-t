### Explaining the FAISS module and its mechanism behind. 

In a nutshell, it's a supercharged "find similar things" tool, that helps accelerate the process where indexing a data point vector is needed. The process involves something called quantization of the databased vectors. To understand what quantization really is in a very rudimentary way, it's like rounding numbers to the nearest digits but here we are rounding vectors. 

It's a way to compress the data points so we could navigate and scale billions of data. 


### The Main Math Behind it is a very simple probabilty concept called finding the centroid
